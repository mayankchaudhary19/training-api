# Python Flask Project 

This is a Flask Web-App. 
I have created this web app so that, students could choose training course of their own choice, giving them freedom to learn.

The web app allows user to register on the app, his/her data is uploaded on Mlab using PyMongo. HTML Rendering is used to show the Web Pages and the web-app is Deployed using Heroku !

Some Other Features:

Basic login fuctionality allows user to access the account. 
When the user Sign-in, web-app shows users personal details, preferences, Receipt No., and Slot and also 
allows user to edit or delete the changes.
